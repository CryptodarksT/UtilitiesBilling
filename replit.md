- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and schemas

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses three main tables:
- **customers** - Store customer information (ID, name, address, phone, email)
- **bills** - Store bill information (customer ID, bill type, provider, amount, status, due date)
- **payments** - Store payment records (bill ID, amount, payment method, transaction ID, status)

### API Endpoints

## Data Flow

1. User searches for a bill using customer ID and bill type
2. System queries the database for matching bills and customer information
3. Bill details are displayed with available payment methods
4. User selects payment method and initiates payment
5. Payment record is created and processed
6. Payment status is updated and confirmed

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Vite dev server for frontend with hot module replacement
- Express server with TypeScript compilation via tsx
- Database migrations handled by Drizzle Kit

### Production Build
- Frontend builds to static files in `dist/public`
- Backend compiles to `dist/index.js` using esbuild
- Database schema deployment via `npm run db:push`

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Development and production build scripts configured
- TypeScript configuration covers all source directories

The application demonstrates modern full-stack development practices with type safety, proper separation of concerns, and a clean architecture that supports both development and production deployment.
